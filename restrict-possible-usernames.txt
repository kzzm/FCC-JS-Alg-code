let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
// Almost there with this solution. 
// However it doesn't like Z97 - First letter and two numbers
let userCheck = /^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+\d*$/; // Change this line

// This one lets too much through "J" and "A1"
//let userCheck = /^[A-Za-z]+\d*$/; // Change this line
let result = userCheck.test(username);

// What I needed to know is that ( ) is a valid construct
// This concept is "capture group"
// I also forgot to use the "ignore" feature "i"


//Interesting that this does NOT work
let userCheck = /^[a-z]([a-z]+\d*$ | [0-9][0-9]+)/i; // Change this line
// Turns out the end anchor needs to be moved outside the group
// Since the entire capture group is the end anchor
// The extra whitespace to make it READABLE also caused it to FAIL, 
// since WHITESPACE is NOT ignored

//Both of these work
let userCheck = /^[a-z]([a-z]+\d*|[0-9][0-9])$/i;  <-- The use case Z97 only has two numbers
let userCheck = /^[a-z]([a-z]+\d*|[0-9][0-9]+)$/i; <-- Similiar to checking for Z97, but would also catch Z971, Z9712,etc

let userCheck = /^[a-z]([0-9][0-9]+|[a-z]+\d*)$/i;
